A trainable convolutional neural network coded inside a fragment shader.

## Overview
* Three version of SimpNet: Python, C++, HLSL
* Python + Keras version is the high level overview of the network structure, also does the offline training.
* C++ + OpenCV version is a low level version to help me convert the network into HLSL
* HLSL version is the one used in-game in VRChat
